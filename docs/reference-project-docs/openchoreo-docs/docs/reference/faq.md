# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is OpenChoreo?

OpenChoreo is an open-source Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that simplifies cloud-native application development by providing developer-friendly abstractions over complex Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.

### How is OpenChoreo different from other platforms?

OpenChoreo focuses on:

- **Developer Experience**: Simple abstractions without losing Kubernetes power
- **Security by Default**: Built-in security with cell-based architecture
- **CNCF Integration**: Orchestrates best-in-class cloud-native tools
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with no vendor lock-in

### What are the main benefits of using OpenChoreo?

- **Faster Time to Market**: Deploy applications in minutes instead of days
- **Reduced Complexity**: Focus on business logic instead of infrastructure
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade capabilities from day one
- **Consistent Environments**: Identical configurations across all stages

## Getting Started

### What are the prerequisites for OpenChoreo?

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Version 1.32 or later
- **kubectl**: v1.32+ configured to access your cluster
- **Helm**: Version 3.x (for installation)
- **Container Registry**: For storing application images (required for CI workflows)

### How do I install OpenChoreo?

Choose your path:

- **Quick Try**: [Run Locally](../getting-started/try-it-out/on-k3d-locally.mdx) or [On Your Environment](../getting-started/try-it-out/on-your-environment.mdx)
- **Production**: See the [Platform Engineer Guide](../platform-engineer-guide/deployment-topology.mdx) for production configuration

### Can I try OpenChoreo locally?

Yes! The [local setup guide](../getting-started/try-it-out/on-k3d-locally.mdx) lets you try OpenChoreo on your laptop with k3d.

### What's the simplest way to deploy my first application?

Follow [Deploy and Explore](../getting-started/deploy-and-explore.mdx)

## Architecture & Concepts

### What is a "Cell" in OpenChoreo?

A Cell is OpenChoreo's security boundary that:

- Isolates applications using Kubernetes namespaces
- Enforces network policies with Cilium
- Provides encrypted communication with mTLS
- Implements identity-based access controls
- Usually this is a Project in OpenChoreo

### How does OpenChoreo handle multi-environment deployments?

OpenChoreo uses Environment abstractions that:

- Define deployment targets (dev, staging, prod)
- Apply environment-specific configurations
- Enforce resource quotas and policies
- Enable promotion workflows between environments

### What's the difference between a Project and a Component?

- **Project**: A logical grouping of related components (e.g., an e-commerce platform)
- **Component**: An individual deployable unit (e.g., user-service, payment-api)

### How does OpenChoreo integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?

OpenChoreo supports two approaches:

- **Built-in CI**: Argo Workflows-based pipelines with Dockerfile and buildpack builders, configured by platform engineers and triggered by developers or Git webhooks (auto-build)
- **External CI**: Use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI platforms to build images and call the OpenChoreo [Workload API](../platform-engineer-guide/workflows/external-ci.mdx) to create deployments
- **`occ` CLI**: The OpenChoreo CLI can trigger builds, monitor workflow runs, and manage deployments from any CI system

## Performance & Deployment

### What are the resource requirements for OpenChoreo?

**Control Plane (minimum)**:

- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended with observability plane)
- **Storage**: 20 GB

### Can OpenChoreo work with multiple clusters?

Yes, you can setup the following patterns

- **All in one cluster**: Where all the planes are in a single cluster
- **Combined clusters**: Where a combination of planes are together spread across multiple clusters
  e.g. control plane separate and others together, observability plane separate and others together
- **Totally separated clusters**: Where each plane has its own cluster. Note that this is not usually for a local setup.
