# Developer Abstractions

Developer abstractions in OpenChoreo enable teams to build, deploy, and operate cloud-native applications without
managing infrastructure complexity. These abstractions provide a declarative model for expressing application
architecture, dependencies, and operational requirements while the platform handles the underlying Kubernetes resources,
networking, and security configurations automatically.

## Project

A **Project** represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design terms - a cohesive collection of components that
together implement a specific business capability or application domain. It serves as the primary organizational unit
for developers, defining clear boundaries for code ownership, deployment coordination, and operational responsibility.

Projects establish both logical and physical boundaries in the platform. Logically, they group related components that
share common business logic, data models, and team ownership. Physically, they translate into isolated deployment units
with dedicated namespaces, network boundaries, and security policies. This alignment between organizational structure
and technical architecture enables teams to work autonomously while maintaining clear integration points with other
projects.

The project boundary also defines the scope for internal communication and shared resources. Components within a project
can communicate freely with each other. This locality principle reduces complexity for
developers while maintaining security and isolation between different application domains.

## Component

A **Component** represents a deployable unit of software - the fundamental building block of applications in OpenChoreo.
Each component encapsulates a specific piece of functionality, whether it's a microservice handling business logic, a
web application serving user interfaces, or a background job processing data.

Components use a **ComponentType** reference to determine their deployment characteristics. This reference is a structured
object with `kind` and `name` fields, where `kind` specifies the resource type (`ComponentType` or `ClusterComponentType`,
defaulting to `ComponentType`) and `name` follows the `{workloadType}/{componentTypeName}` format, such as
`deployment/web-service` or `cronjob/data-processor`. The default platform setup provides ClusterComponentTypes that are
visible to all namespaces, so you should set `kind: ClusterComponentType` explicitly when referencing them. Namespace-scoped ComponentTypes can be used for isolation. This explicit typing allows
platform engineers to define multiple variations of deployment patterns for the same workload type, each tuned for
different use cases.

The Component resource connects four essential elements:

**ComponentType Reference** specifies which platform-defined template governs this component's deployment. The
ComponentType defines the available configuration schema, resource templates, and allowed workflows. This separation
of concerns means developers work with a simplified interface while platform engineers maintain control over
infrastructure patterns.

**Parameters** provide the component-specific configuration values that conform to the schema defined in the
ComponentType. When a ComponentRelease is created, these parameter values are captured in the release snapshot. The
same values then apply wherever that release is deployed—if you deploy the same ComponentRelease to dev, staging, and
prod, the parameters are identical across all environments. To change parameter values, you update the Component and
create a new ComponentRelease. Environment-specific values (like resource limits or storage sizes) are handled
separately through `environmentConfigs` in ReleaseBinding resources.

**Traits** enable composition of additional capabilities into the component. Each trait instance adds specific
functionality like persistent storage, caching, or monitoring. Traits can be instantiated multiple times with
different configurations using unique instance names. For example, a component might attach multiple persistent volume
traits for different storage needs, each with its own size, storage class, and mount configuration. Traits use the
same schema-driven approach as ComponentTypes, with parameters set in the Component and environment-specific overrides
applied through ReleaseBinding resources.

**Workflow Configuration** optionally specifies how to build the component from source code. This references a
Workflow and provides the developer-configured schema values needed to execute builds. The workflow integration
enables automated container image creation triggered by code changes or manual developer actions.

The component abstraction thus becomes a declarative specification that combines:

- A ComponentType that defines _how_ to deploy
- Parameters that configure _what_ to deploy
- Traits that compose _additional capabilities_
- A Workflow that defines _how to build_

This composition-based approach enables developers to assemble complex applications from reusable building blocks
while the platform ensures consistency, governance, and operational best practices through the underlying ComponentType
and Trait templates.

## Workload

A **Workload** defines the runtime contract of a component - specifying what the component needs to run. The workload
focuses on application requirements rather than infrastructure details, which are handled by the platform through ComponentTypes.

Each component has one workload that describes its runtime needs through several key specifications:

**Container** defines the container image to deploy, along with its commands, arguments, and environment variables.
This tells the platform what code to run and how to configure it.

**Endpoints** specify the network interfaces that the component exposes - the ports and protocols it listens on. Each
endpoint declares its type (HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL, Websocket, TCP, or UDP) and port number. These definitions tell the
platform what network services the component provides, enabling automatic service creation and network policy generation.

**Dependencies** declare the component's dependencies on other services, whether internal to the platform or external
third-party services. Each dependency specifies how to inject service information into the component through environment
variables. This enables the platform to manage service discovery, configure network policies, and track dependencies.

This declarative specification can be generated from configuration files in the source repository or applied directly
to the cluster. The separation between workload (what the application needs) and ComponentType (how the platform provides it)
enables platform teams to control infrastructure policies while developers focus on application requirements. Resource
limits, scaling parameters, and operational policies come from the ComponentType and Traits, while the
workload simply declares what the application needs to function.

## WorkflowRun

A **WorkflowRun** represents a runtime execution instance of a Workflow. While Workflows define the automation template
and parameter schema, WorkflowRuns represent actual executions with specific parameter values.

WorkflowRuns bridge the gap between developer intent and automation execution. Developers create WorkflowRun resources
to trigger workflows, providing parameter values. The platform handles all the complexity of rendering the final
workflow specification, resolving external references, synchronizing secrets, and managing execution in the workflow plane.

Each WorkflowRun captures:

**Workflow Reference and Parameters** specify which Workflow to execute and provide the developer-supplied parameter
values. These values are validated against the Workflow's parameter schema, which can include repository URLs, build
configuration, test modes, resource allocations, and any other fields the platform engineer has defined.

**Component Ownership** (for CI workflows) is tracked through metadata labels (`openchoreo.dev/component` and
`openchoreo.dev/project`) that link the execution to a specific component and project. This enables traceability,
build history per component, and component-specific operations. These labels are accessible in the Workflow's CEL
expressions for injecting component context into the execution.

**Execution Status** tracks the workflow through conditions (`WorkflowRunning`, `WorkflowCompleted`,
`WorkflowSucceeded`, `WorkflowFailed`), individual task status with a vendor-neutral step abstraction, timestamps,
and references to the actual workflow plane resources for debugging and cleanup.

This abstraction provides a unified interface for both generic automation and component builds, where developers
interact with curated parameter schemas rather than complex CI/CD pipeline definitions. The separation of concerns
allows platform engineers to control workflow implementation and security policies through Workflow templates while
developers manage parameter values through WorkflowRun instances. WorkflowRuns can be created manually for ad-hoc
executions or automatically by platform controllers in response to code changes, supporting both interactive development
and fully automated CI/CD pipelines.
