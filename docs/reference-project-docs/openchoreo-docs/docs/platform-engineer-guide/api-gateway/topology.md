# API Gateway Topology

OpenChoreo has a well-architected API Gateway topology designed to cater to a wide range of API Gateway use cases. The topology is built on top of three main principles:

1. **Traffic Direction** — Whether traffic flows into the cluster (Ingress) or out of it (Egress)
2. **Networking Configuration** — Whether the gateway is exposed externally to the internet or internally within the cluster network / VPC
3. **Granularity** — Whether the gateway is shared at the DataPlane level or dedicated to a specific Environment

These three dimensions can be combined to describe any gateway in an OpenChoreo deployment.

## Default Gateway

By default, OpenChoreo installs one gateway at the DataPlane level:

| Gateway                  | Traffic Direction | Networking | Granularity |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Ingress External Gateway | Ingress           | External   | DataPlane   |

With this default configuration, APIs and routes deployed across all environments are hosted as unique virtual hosts on the shared DataPlane level gateway. This keeps infrastructure costs low and is well suited for basic use cases where environments do not have strict isolation requirements.

## Internal Gateway

By default, the DataPlane gateway is internet-facing (external). For traffic that should not be exposed to the public internet — such as service-to-service communication or traffic restricted to a private VPC subnet — you can add an **internal gateway**.

An internal gateway can be configured in two ways depending on your environment:

- **`ClusterIP`** — accessible only within the cluster, suitable for pure in-cluster service-to-service traffic
- **`LoadBalancer`** — accessible within the VPC/private network but not the public internet, suitable when services span multiple nodes or clusters within a private network (using cloud provider annotations such as `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"`)

```
External Gateway (LoadBalancer)     Internal Gateway (ClusterIP or internal LB)
───────────────────────────────     ──────────────────────────────────────────
  Accessible from the internet        Not accessible from the public internet
  ├── dev virtual host                ├── dev virtual host
  ├── staging virtual host            ├── staging virtual host
  └── production virtual host         └── production virtual host
```

:::note
The configuration steps below are based on the default **kgateway** API gateway module. If you are using a different API gateway module, refer to that module's documentation instead. Available gateway modules are listed in the [modules](/modules) page.

### Configuring an Internal Gateway

**Step 1: Create GatewayParameters**

Create a `GatewayParameters` resource to configure the underlying service type. The example below uses `ClusterIP` for in-cluster-only access:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
kind: GatewayParameters
metadata:
  name: internal-gateway-params
  namespace: openchoreo-data-plane
spec:
  kube:
    service:
      type: ClusterIP
      extraLabels:
        gateway: internal
```

To use a VPC-internal LoadBalancer instead, set `type: LoadBalancer` and add the appropriate cloud provider annotation. For example, on AWS:

```yaml
spec:
  kube:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
      extraAnnotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
      extraLabels:
        gateway: internal
```

**Step 2: Create the Internal Gateway**

Reference the `GatewayParameters` via the `infrastructure.parametersRef` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-internal
  namespace: openchoreo-data-plane
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: gateway
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: openchoreo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kgateway
  infrastructure:
    labels:
      openchoreo.dev/system-component: gateway
    parametersRef:
      name: internal-gateway-params
      group: gateway.kgateway.dev
      kind: GatewayParameters
  listeners:
    - name: http
      port: 9080
      protocol: HTTP
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
```

**Step 3: Register on the DataPlane**

Register the internal gateway on the `DataPlane` resource so OpenChoreo routes internal traffic through it:

```bash
kubectl patch dataplane default -n default --type merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "gateway": {
      "ingress": {
        "internal": {
          "name": "gateway-internal",
          "namespace": "openchoreo-data-plane",
          "http": {
            "host": "gateway-internal.openchoreo-data-plane",
            "listenerName": "http",
            "port": 9080
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Alternatively, you can update this configuration from the Backstage portal. Navigate to **Catalog** > **Dataplane**, select the relevant Dataplane, go to the **Definition** tab, and update the YAML definition.

<img
src={require("./dataplane.png").default}
alt="Backstage Dataplane Definition tab"
/>

For a `ClusterIP` gateway, set `host` to the in-cluster DNS name of the gateway service: `<service-name>.<namespace>`.

For an internal `LoadBalancer` gateway, the host depends on your DNS setup. Your cloud provider will assign a private hostname or IP to the load balancer (for example, an internal ELB DNS name on AWS). You can use that hostname directly, or create a DNS record in your private hosted zone pointing to it. If you use [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), it can manage these records automatically when configured with the appropriate annotation filters for internal services.

## Environment Gateway

OpenChoreo supports environment-level gateways for advanced use cases where a dedicated gateway is required for a specific environment — such as a production environment that demands traffic isolation, independent scaling, or separate TLS termination.

```
DataPlane Level Gateway          Environment Level Gateway
───────────────────────          ─────────────────────────
  ├── development traffic                  └── production traffic
  └── staging traffic
```

This allows you to start with the cost-efficient default topology and progressively introduce dedicated gateways for environments that require stricter isolation or higher availability guarantees.

### Configuring an Environment Gateway

**Step 1: Create the Gateway**

Create a new `Gateway` resource in the `openchoreo-data-plane` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-production
  namespace: openchoreo-data-plane
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: gateway
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: openchoreo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kgateway
  infrastructure:
    labels:
      openchoreo.dev/system-component: gateway
  listeners:
    - name: http
      port: 19081
      protocol: HTTP
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
```

:::tip k3d users
If you are running k3d locally, add a port mapping to the load balancer node before creating the gateway:

```bash
k3d node edit k3d-openchoreo-serverlb --port-add 19081:19081/tcp
```

:::

**Step 2: Register on the Environment**

Patch the target `Environment` CR to override the gateway for that environment:

```bash
kubectl patch environment production -n default --type merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "gateway": {
      "ingress": {
        "external": {
          "name": "gateway-production",
          "namespace": "openchoreo-data-plane",
          "http": {
            "host": "openchoreoapis.localhost",
            "listenerName": "http",
            "port": 19081
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Alternatively, you can update this configuration from the Backstage portal. Navigate to **Catalog** > **Environment**, select the relevant Environment, go to the **Definition** tab, and update the YAML definition.

<img
src={require("./environment.png").default}
alt="Backstage Environment Definition tab"
/>

OpenChoreo will then route all APIs and routes belonging to that environment through the dedicated gateway instead of the shared Dataplane level gateway.
