# Workflows in OpenChoreo

OpenChoreo provides a unified **Workflow** design for running automation tasks. Whether you need component CI builds, infrastructure provisioning, data pipelines, or any other automation, it all uses the same Workflow and WorkflowRun resources.

:::note
OpenChoreo currently supports only Argo Workflows as the underlying engine for executing workflows. It can be extended to support more Kubernetes-native engines.

## Multi-Plane Architecture

- **Control Plane**: Hosts Workflow and WorkflowRun CRs, orchestrates execution
- **Workflow Plane**: Executes Argo Workflows using ClusterWorkflowTemplates, performs compute-intensive operations
- **Communication**: Control plane controller connects to workflow plane via a websocket connection

In Single Cluster Setup, both planes run in the same cluster.

## Core Resources

### Workflow

A **Workflow** is a platform engineer-defined template that specifies _what_ to execute. It consists of:

- **Schema**: Defines developer-facing parameters that can be configured when triggering an execution
- **RunTemplate**: An inline Argo Workflow manifest with CEL expressions (`${metadata.*}`, `${parameters.*}`, `${externalRefs['<id>'].spec.*}`) that composes one or more ClusterWorkflowTemplates into a pipeline
- **Resources**: Additional Kubernetes resources needed for the workflow (e.g., ExternalSecrets for credentials)
- **ExternalRefs**: References to external CRs (e.g., `SecretReference`) resolved at runtime and injected into the CEL context
- **TTLAfterCompletion**: Optional duration after which completed runs are automatically deleted

Workflows live in the control plane and bridge it to the workflow plane where actual execution happens.

### WorkflowRun

A **WorkflowRun** represents a single execution instance. When created, it:

- References the Workflow to use
- Provides actual values for the schema parameters
- Triggers the controller to render and execute the Argo Workflow in the workflow plane
- Tracks execution state through conditions and task status

:::warning Imperative Resource
WorkflowRun is an **imperative** resource, it triggers an action rather than declaring a desired state. Do not include WorkflowRuns in GitOps repositories. Instead, create them through Git webhooks, the UI, or direct `occ apply` commands.
:::

### Argo ClusterWorkflowTemplate

An Argo **ClusterWorkflowTemplate** (CWT) is an [Argo Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cluster-workflow-templates/) resource that defines a **single reusable step** at cluster scope in the workflow plane. Each CWT encapsulates one discrete operation - cloning a repo, building an image, pushing to a registry, etc.

CWTs are **not full pipelines**. Instead, the Workflow CR's `runTemplate` contains an inline Argo Workflow that composes multiple CWTs into a pipeline using per-step `templateRef` references:

```yaml
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
spec:
  runTemplate:
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Workflow
    metadata:
      name: ${metadata.workflowRunName}
      namespace: workflows-${metadata.namespaceName}
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: workflow-sa
      entrypoint: pipeline
      templates:
        - name: pipeline
          steps:
            - - name: checkout-source
                templateRef:
                  name: checkout-source
                  template: checkout
                  clusterScope: true
            - - name: build-image
                templateRef:
                  name: docker
                  template: build-image
                  clusterScope: true
```

:::info You don't create Argo Workflow CRs by hand
At runtime, OpenChoreo renders `runTemplate` and creates an Argo `Workflow` **instance** in the workflow plane.
As a Platform Engineer, you only author the inline template inside the Workflow CR's `runTemplate`.
:::

:::tip Why Cluster Workflow Templates?
We are recommending to use Argo ClusterWorkflowTemplates for all steps to maximize reuse and maintainability. This way, you can update the logic of a step (e.g., how to build a Docker image) in one place and have it automatically applied to all Workflows that reference it.

## Workflow Type

### Generic Workflows

Generic workflows execute standalone automation tasks not tied to any component. Use them for:

- **Infrastructure Provisioning** — Terraform, Pulumi, or cloud resource automation
- **Data Processing (ETL)** — Extract, transform, and load pipelines
- **End-to-End Testing** — Integration and acceptance test suites
- **Package Publishing** — Publishing libraries to npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.
- **Custom Docker Builds** — Container image builds not tied to a component

### CI Workflows

CI workflows (also known as component workflows) are regular Workflow CRs used within Components. They enable:

- **Auto-builds** triggered by Git webhooks
- **UI integration** for CI workflow management
- **ComponentType governance** via `allowedWorkflows`
- **Workload generation** from build outputs

In OpenChoreo, a Workflow is "component-capable" when:

1. It carries `openchoreo.dev/workflow-type: "component"` (required for UI to categorize CI workflows)
2. It is referenced by a Component via `Component.spec.workflow.name`
3. It is explicitly allowed by the ComponentType via `ComponentType.spec.allowedWorkflows`

See [CI Governance](./ci-governance.md) for the full guide.

### Resource Cleanup

WorkflowRuns can be cleaned up in two ways:

**Manual Deletion**: When deleted via `kubectl delete`, the controller removes all resources created in the workflow plane.

**Automatic TTL-based Cleanup**: Platform engineers configure `ttlAfterCompletion` in the Workflow template:

```yaml
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: docker
spec:
  ttlAfterCompletion: "7d" # Retain for 7 days after completion
  # ...
```

**TTL format**: Duration string without spaces — days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s). Examples: `"90d"`, `"1h30m"`, `"1d12h30m15s"`.
