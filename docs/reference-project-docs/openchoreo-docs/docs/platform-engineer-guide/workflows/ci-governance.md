# CI Governance

CI workflows (also called component workflows) are [Workflows](./overview.md) that integrate with OpenChoreo's component system to provide automated builds. This page covers how to configure CI-specific labels, schema extensions, and governance rules.

For creating workflows, see [Creating Workflows](./creating-workflows.mdx). For the developer perspective on using CI workflows, see [CI Workflows](../../developer-guide/workflows/ci/overview.md).

## CI Workflow Requirements

A Workflow becomes a CI workflow when:

1. **It carries `openchoreo.dev/workflow-type: "component"`** label — Required for UI and CLI to categorize the workflow
2. **A Component references it** via `Component.spec.workflow.name`
3. **It is listed in `ComponentType.spec.allowedWorkflows`** — This is how you control which workflows are available for components of a given type

There is no separate CRD: CI workflows are just Workflows that are allowed by a ComponentType and referenced by Components.

## Labels and Schema Extensions

### `openchoreo.dev/workflow-type` label

Required for workflows intended to be used by Components. The UI and CLI use this label to identify and categorize a workflow as a CI workflow.

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    openchoreo.dev/workflow-type: "component"
```

### Vendor extension fields for Auto-Build and UI

CI workflows must annotate specific `openAPIV3Schema` fields with `x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-*` vendor extensions. These extensions tell OpenChoreo which parameter fields correspond to repository settings, enabling the auto-build feature (triggered by Git webhooks) and UI integration.

| Extension                                                | Purpose                                 | Required |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-url`        | Identifies the Git repository URL field | No       |
| `x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-branch`     | Identifies the Git branch field         | No       |
| `x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-commit`     | Identifies the Git commit SHA field     | No       |
| `x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-app-path`   | Identifies the application path field   | No       |
| `x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-secret-ref` | Identifies the secret reference field   | No       |

Add `true` to each extension on the corresponding schema field:

```yaml
parameters:
  openAPIV3Schema:
    type: object
    required:
      - repository
    properties:
      repository:
        type: object
        description: "Git repository configuration"
        required:
          - url
        properties:
          url:
            type: string
            description: "Git repository URL"
            x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-url: true
          secretRef:
            type: string
            default: ""
            description: "Secret reference name for Git credentials"
            x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-secret-ref: true
          revision:
            type: object
            default: {}
            properties:
              branch:
                type: string
                default: main
                description: "Git branch to checkout"
                x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-branch: true
              commit:
                type: string
                default: ""
                description: "Git commit SHA or reference (optional, defaults to latest)"
                x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-commit: true
          appPath:
            type: string
            default: "."
            description: "Path to the application directory within the repository"
            x-openchoreo-component-parameter-repository-app-path: true
```

:::tip
The field structure (nesting, names) is flexible — OpenChoreo discovers the fields by walking the schema tree for these extensions, regardless of where they are placed. These extensions are **required if you use auto-build** (Git webhook-triggered builds), and optional otherwise to enable richer UI behavior.

## WorkflowRun Labels

When a WorkflowRun is created for a component, it carries labels that link it to the component:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    openchoreo.dev/component: greeter-service
    openchoreo.dev/project: default
```

These labels are accessible in the Workflow CR's CEL expressions:

- `${metadata.labels['openchoreo.dev/component']}` — Component name
- `${metadata.labels['openchoreo.dev/project']}` — Project name

## Governance via ComponentTypes

Platform engineers control which CI workflows are available for components using ComponentType's `allowedWorkflows` field. This is the primary governance mechanism for CI workflows.

### How It Works

1. **Platform Engineer defines `allowedWorkflows`** in a ComponentType
2. **When a developer creates a Component**, they must reference a workflow in `spec.workflow.name`
3. **The Component controller validates** that the referenced workflow is in the ComponentType's `allowedWorkflows` list
4. **If validation fails**, the Component enters a Failed state with a condition explaining the error

### allowedWorkflows Field

```yaml
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterComponentType
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  # Restrict components to using only these ClusterWorkflows
  allowedWorkflows:
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: dockerfile-builder
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: gcp-buildpacks-builder
```

Each entry has two fields:

- **`kind`** — `ClusterWorkflow` (cluster-scoped) or `Workflow` (namespace-scoped). Defaults to `ClusterWorkflow`.
- **`name`** — Name of the workflow resource.

Only Workflows listed in `allowedWorkflows` can be referenced by Components of this type.

### Governance Patterns

**Pattern 1: Single Workflow (Strict)**

```yaml
spec:
  allowedWorkflows:
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: dockerfile-builder
```

**Pattern 2: Multiple Workflows (Developer Choice)**

```yaml
spec:
  allowedWorkflows:
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: dockerfile-builder
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: gcp-buildpacks-builder
    - kind: Workflow
      name: custom-react-builder
```

**Pattern 3: Language-Specific Workflows**

```yaml
spec:
  allowedWorkflows:
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: dockerfile-builder # For compiled languages
    - kind: ClusterWorkflow
      name: gcp-buildpacks-builder # For interpreted languages
```

### Validation and Error Handling

#### Component-level validation

When a Component references a workflow that's not in `allowedWorkflows`, the Component controller rejects it:

```yaml
conditions:
  - type: Ready
    status: False
    reason: WorkflowNotAllowed
    message: "Workflow 'custom-workflow' is not in ComponentType 'backend' allowedWorkflows"
```

The Component will not proceed to creating WorkflowRuns until the workflow is either added to `allowedWorkflows` or changed to one that is allowed.

#### WorkflowRun-level validation

When a WorkflowRun is created with component labels (`openchoreo.dev/component` and `openchoreo.dev/project`), the WorkflowRun controller performs additional validations before execution:

| Validation                 | Condition Reason            | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Both labels required       | `ComponentValidationFailed` | If one of `openchoreo.dev/project` or `openchoreo.dev/component` is set, both must be present     |
| Component exists           | `ComponentValidationFailed` | The referenced Component must exist in the same namespace                                         |
| Project label matches      | `ComponentValidationFailed` | The `openchoreo.dev/project` label must match the Component's owner project                       |
| ComponentType exists       | `ComponentValidationFailed` | The Component's ComponentType (or ClusterComponentType) must exist                                |
| Workflow allowed           | `ComponentValidationFailed` | The workflow referenced by the WorkflowRun must be in the ComponentType's `allowedWorkflows`      |
| Workflow matches component | `ComponentValidationFailed` | If the Component has `spec.workflow` configured, the WorkflowRun must reference the same workflow |
| Workflow exists            | `WorkflowNotFound`          | The referenced Workflow or ClusterWorkflow must exist in the cluster                              |
| WorkflowPlane available    | `WorkflowPlaneNotFound`     | A WorkflowPlane must be available for the workflow                                                |

All `ComponentValidationFailed` conditions are permanent failures. `WorkflowPlaneNotFound` is transient and retried automatically.

### Benefits of This Governance Model

1. **Security** — Platform engineers ensure only approved build processes are used
2. **Consistency** — All components of a type follow the same build patterns
3. **Compliance** — Easy to enforce organizational policies (e.g., "all builds must scan for vulnerabilities")
4. **Flexibility** — Different component types can have different allowed workflows
5. **Developer Experience** — Clear error messages when trying to use disallowed workflows

## Default CI Workflows

OpenChoreo ships with four default ClusterWorkflow CRs and their supporting ClusterWorkflowTemplates:

| ClusterWorkflow               | Build CWT                   | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dockerfile-builder`          | `containerfile-build`       | Build with a provided Dockerfile/Containerfile/Podmanfile     |
| `gcp-buildpacks-builder`      | `gcp-buildpacks-build`      | Supports Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and .NET applications     |
| `paketo-buildpacks-builder`   | `paketo-buildpacks-build`   | Supports Java, Node.js, Python, Go, .NET, Ruby, PHP, and more |
| `ballerina-buildpack-builder` | `ballerina-buildpack-build` | Builds applications written in Ballerina                      |
